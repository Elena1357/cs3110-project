Instructions for Running and Playing the Game:

Game objective: Write code to move agent on a grid and achieve the indicated 
winning state.

To run the game:

- After you unzip navigate to the directory of the Makefile

- On command shell, type "make run".

- When prompted to pick level, enter "1", "2", or "3". Those are the 3 sample
levels we currently have.

- When prompted to enter code, write code that would solve the given task,
following the syntax described below. It is possible to come up with long or 
short solutions to the level. In the future, we will implement a point system 
rewarding more efficient solutions. 

- After entering code, press "n" to step the simulation of the agent's 
movements based on the move sequence your code provided.

- Simulation will terminate with the appropriate message, either when you 
achieve the winning state, or your code terminates in a non-winning state. 
You can press "q" any time during the simulation stage to quit.

Game language syntax:
'M' - Move Forward
'R' - Turn Right
'L' - Turn Left
'1' - Color Square Red
'2' - Color Square Green
'3' - Color Square Blue
'f=' - Define Function f
'[f]' - Call Function f
';' - Separator between "lines of code".

All function definitions must be declared before any commands.

Example valid code entries:

"MMR1MML2MM" -> Move sequence to execute.

"f=MMR1MML2MM;[f]" -> Defines function f, then calls it.

"g=MML2;f=MMR1[g]MM;[f]" -> Defines functions g and f, (definition of f uses 
application of g), calls f.

"f=MMR1[f];[f]" -> Defines recursive function f, and calls it. (Infinite 
recursion is allowed, game will terminate if winning state is achieved at any 
point during the execution. We used streams to enable player code to provide 
infinite move sequences.)
